## Ion2G HF-ALE

One of the most effective Automatic Link Establishment platforms for civilian HF radios. This
program, when installed on a computer linked to an HF radio (with compatible antenna), allows
operators to remove the guesswork of which HF band will work best for their intended communication.
In short, ALE software such as this simply “scans” all of the HF bands, and automatically selects
the best one for a link to be established between two or more radios. This provides the advantages
of being very hard to direction find, and very resistant to jamming, albeit with a much more complex
system that is relatively new to civilian HF radio. ALE is tough to implement on the civilian side of
radio comms, but with better SDR-based radios, and easier to use software coming to the market,
ALE technology is a very valuable addition to any comm plan. However, the somewhat developmental
nature of ALE software is still not reliable enough to forgo the usual contingency communication
methods (such as JS8Call), which are much more established, reliable, and easy for everyone to use
with most hardware and antenna systems.
