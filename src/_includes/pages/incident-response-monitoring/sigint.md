## Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)

**ADS-B receiver** - Aircraft Monitoring

**KrakenSDR Passive Radar -** For limited Passive Radar capability, as well as Direction Finding capabilities.

**SDR w/ Scanner feature -** For identifying signals of interest in a local area.

**Laptop, Tablet, or PC capable of running Windows or Linux OS -** For processing signals with an SDR. Note:
Several options exist for processing SDR signals on an Android smartphone, so this can be an option for
limited work. However, for more substantial SIGINT processing tools, most smartphones do not have the
processing (or CPU cooling capabilities) to get the job done, making a laptop or tablet the best overall
choice.
