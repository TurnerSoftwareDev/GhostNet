Establishing a truly global communications plan is difficult, simply due to the physics of ionospheric propagation.
There is no one plan that will allow the globe to communicate at the exact same time; various factors
such as time of day, frequency, and scheduling conflicts make this a challenge. Even if a solution can be
agreed upon, scheduling conflicts would add in another layer of complexity. Therefore, multiple networks are
required. We can get by with two main concepts for communication: Local comms nets, and long-range links
with other continents or major population centers. This way, a person can get their gear set up for local information
exchange during one comm window, and if so desired can switch their gear and data modes to make
contact with extremely long range regions, when band conditions allow for the highest chance of success.
