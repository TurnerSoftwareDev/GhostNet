## Communications Intelligence (COMINT)

**ACARS receiver (HF and VHF bands) -** Configured to decode ACARS traffic from aircraft in the local area.

**L-Band Antenna for SDR -** For intercepting commercial aviation SATCOM ACARS messages.

**General Purpose Scanner -** Preferably with trunking capability. For monitoring unsecured local comms.

**SDR w/ Scanner feature -** Additional tool for monitoring unsecured comms in a local area.

**HF Transceiver -** Communication and information sharing/collection tool.

**Laptop, Tablet, or PC capable of running Windows or Linux OS -** For interfacing with an SDR or Transceiver.
Handheld Analog VHF/UHF Transceiver - Can be used for unsecured local comms, but also can be used
to monitor local ham radio repeater networks in a time of crisis. These info networks are historically
unreliable for HUMINT purposes, but worth monitoring to determine how widespread an incident is.
