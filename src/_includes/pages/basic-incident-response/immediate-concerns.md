## Step 1: Physical Security

Don’t Panic. Establish personal security FIRST! All other comms and incident response actions can wait
until you are secure. If security is not guaranteed, some level of tactical comms might be prioritized over
personal safety, depending on the tactical situation and the nature of the emergency.

## Step 2: Establish Comms, Determine Players, Send 5 W’s

Once personal safety is established, the originator of the incident/distress call shall make every effort to
establish a communications net and transmit a brief description of the incident. The 5 W’s of Who, What,
When, Where, and Why are a good format to stick to, if no other format exists. If a Troops-in-Contact
report, or a SALUTE report is preferred, use that format instead. If the originator of the incident report is
unable to establish an Incident Response Comms Net, other Net participants shall make every effort to
coordinate a response as needed. As a prepared citizenry is often non-hierarchical, there are no Command
requirements (beyond local group SOPs), so whomever is capable of maintaining the Nets and passing
communications, is the primary party responsible for such action until no longer able.

In the more likely scenario of a person simply hearing of a national event, and wishing to obtain more
information, tuning in to the appropriate radio communications net would be a good idea. Chances are, if
something substantial is going on, people will be sharing information on the GhostNet.
