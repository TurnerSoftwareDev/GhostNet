## Use Common Sense

Though perhaps a dying virtue throughout the general public these days, simply observing what’s going
on and making rational decisions is really helpful in the field of radio. Again, with radio there’s very little
content moderation. If it weren’t for the FCC’s regulations there would be no rules at all, and even so most
radio etiquette is all but impossible to enforce. Radio is the last bastion of the technical ability to remain
free to speak. With that comes great responsibility and the duty to ensure that the goodness we wish to see
in the world is reflected in our actions. If someone is sharing a valuable information report, or is providing
updates on a world even in real time, it might not be a super great idea to rag-chew right next to them. If
the band is a bit busy, and you have a smaller group of friends you’d like to contact, feel free to move to a
clear freq. The main freq is just a common gathering place; a tool for all of you to use. And remember, these
Best Practices are just helpful tips. Not hardline rules. It would be foolish for anyone to expect any type of
enforcement of these recommendations, though I’m sure many will try. There’s no need to shout someone
down for the tiniest transgression of these helpful tips; we’re all learning together and people sometimes
make mistakes. The self-policing nature of radio is what turns off many new users, so lets encourage and
guide each other, rather than cracking down on the smallest error. We’re all in this together, for better or
worse. We may all be strangers separated by distance, but we all want to make the world a better place. So
let’s build a team and work together toward the common goal of helping each other in these tough times.
