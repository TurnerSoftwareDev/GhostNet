## What About My Baofeng?

Unencrypted analog
communications are not generally
recommended for use in
non-permissive environments.
Even using brevity codes and
other EMCOM procedures, voice
recognition, direction finding,
and meta-data analysis make
analog voice comms a risk on
the modern battlefield. However,
due to their low cost and extreme
popularity, handheld VHF/
UHF radios will always have a
place in emergency preparedness
or for local Line of Sight
comms. the GhostNet is not
meant to replace local VHF/UHF
traffic, which warrants it’s own
comm plan. Rather, GhostNet
plans are intended to serve as
a more strategic, region-wide
communications network using
HF transceivers.
