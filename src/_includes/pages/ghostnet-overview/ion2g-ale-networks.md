## Ion2G ALE Networks (“Right Now” Comms)

A bit more advanced than JS8, several ALE networks are set up for persistent communication. Automatic
Link Establishment protocols are the future of HF radio, and a gold standard for determining the best band/
frequency to maintain a comm link. ALE removes the guesswork of which band to choose based on time
of day, or other propagation factors. Simply fire up the program, and the software will determine the best
frequency for you automatically. This makes comm plans obsolete, and allows for “right now” communications
to be possible at any time of day.
