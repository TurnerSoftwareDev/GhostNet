## Weekly JS8Call Nets on 40m

Once per week (or more often, based on world events), users can gather on JS8Call for a brief chat in a
casual atmosphere. JS8 is simple to use, easy to work with, and extremely common among radio hams.
Users that are perhaps not as experienced in other HF data modes might find JS8Call to be an easy way
to maintain contact. JS8 also serves as a great meeting point in the event of catastrophic communication
loss; if a major societal event is occurring, simply hop on JS8 to find out what’s going on and to coordinate
other communications plans.
