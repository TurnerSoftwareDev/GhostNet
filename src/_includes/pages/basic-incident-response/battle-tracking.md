## Step 3: Establish TOC, Staff Functions Begin

A Tactical Operations Center, appropriate to the incident, is to be established as needed. All staff functions
begin to work the issue as their skillsets and capabilities allow. Intelligence and Operations maintain the
primary responsibilities of Threat Assessments and Friendly Forces, respectively. Logistics, Weather, Medical,
Administrative, and dedicated Communications experts also contribute as able. Amongst a prepared
citizenry, most of the standard TOC functions (such as Battle Tracking) will fall to a single person. Do the
best you can, and realize that perfection is not possible. Realistic expectations of operational capabilities
are paramount to maintaining even the smallest measure of effectiveness.
Once a good Battle Rhythm is established, start working on improving effectiveness. Try to improve
communications networks, and get some of the more advanced options (like Ion2G ALE or Winlink) up
and running to make contact with personnel near the affected area. These more advanced actions take
time, and will not be possible to create prior to the incident. Even though very basic comms are the bare
minimum, highly efficient data exchange networks will need to be the eventual end goal if time, skill, and
prior planning makes it possible.

## Step 4: Reassess Situation and Response, Schedule 2-Minute

Drills, Assess Logistical/Personnel Needs
As the incident progresses, people fall into the roles they have trained for. As a citizen-based response will
not have a strong Command element like traditional Incident Command Structures, consideration must be
given to logistical and personnel constraints that will affect operations. Ensure that clear schedules are
communicated. For multi-day incidents be aware that personnel tracking incidents will be volunteers with
other obligations which might dictate their retirement from the operation at a critical juncture. Create a
template and a schedule for Two-Minute Drills, which allow each responding entity convey a status update
from their department quickly and efficiently. Be mindful of logistical needs, particularly energy requirements.
Maintain flexibility as plans change.
