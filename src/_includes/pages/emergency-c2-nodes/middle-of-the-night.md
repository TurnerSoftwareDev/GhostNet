### Waking up in the middle of the night to the distant thumping of artillery rounds is never pleasant.

What do you do? Do you stay put and take cover,
or do you enact your escape plan before
you become encircled by enemy forces? Who
do you need to talk to, or coordinate with?
And how will you do this? And how will you
communicate with those around the region
to share the news, or determine where the
front lines are?
All of this requires substantial communications
planning, equipment, expertise, and dedication
even when you don’t know what to do.
When you are groggily standing in your living
room, listening to the war inching closer, it
would be preferable to be combat effective,
instead of the only option being running for
one’s life. Having a plan to get comms up,
rallying local contacts, beginning an incident
response plan, and getting ready for the fight
ahead makes you a valuable asset to your
community, instead of a noncombatant.
