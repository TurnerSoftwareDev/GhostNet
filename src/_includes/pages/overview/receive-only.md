## Receive-Only Options (For Decoding RTTY, JS8)

To incorporate those who do not have the ability to transmit radio messages, various networks have
been established to allow users to receive crucial information. Radio Teletype, despite being an ancient
communication method, is a great tool for transmitting one-way communications, news updates, or other
critical information to a wide audience. Those wishing to monitor various JS8Call networks or Data Bridges
can also do so with a simple Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver, a computer/phone, and an appropriate
antenna. Understanding that radio communications are difficult, complex, and boring, special emphasis has
been placed on creating networks for users who donâ€™t want/need to dedicate so much time to radios.
In short, we have simple and easy-to-understand networks that users can monitor cheaply and without
any technical knowledge at all. And since receiving messages does not require a license (in the US, at
least), anyone can listen in. Various tutorials have been created (and are continuing to be made) guiding
users step by step through the whole process. The goal for Receive-Only comm networks is to make the
process as easy as possible, and incentivize many people to start treating radio as a viable information
source, rather than a novelty.
