## Typical Use Case Examples

**Standard natural disaster preparedness:** A great use of the GhostNet would be to serve as a common
network that many people can use to share news regarding natural disasters which may have degraded
cellular networks.

**Decentralized, uncensorable, off-grid news network:** The unique nature of HF radio makes censorship very
very difficult. If someone wanted to stop a station from transmitting, they would have to either jam that station,
or physically visit the actual location of the station, and physically stop the transmission. As the world
discovered from the Cuban Jamming incident of 2021, even military grade jamming is not entirely effective
enough to totally stop all communications. Where there is a will, there is a way, and JS8Call (and other
tools) make alternative communications not just possible, but a reliable alternative for the average user.

**Group Messaging:** JS8Call is a powerful group messaging tool. Due to the nature of using offsets, many
people can send messages at the same exact time, only being limited by the time one is transmitting themselves.
A listen-only user can pull up JS8Call and automatically decode multiple messages simultaneously,
receiving messages from many different regions. JS8’s store-and-forward capability allows users to send
messages far beyond their own station’s range. This forms a very basic form of a mesh network, which
although not a true mesh, still offers many of the capabilities of exchanging messages far beyond the line
of sight of just one station.

**ATAK Compatibility:** Through the use of various plugins, the TAK suite of software can function within JS-
8Call. Obviously sending extremely high amounts of CoTs data is not best suited to HF radio, but this could
be a useful feature for those who wish to integrate HF comms into their TAK network.
