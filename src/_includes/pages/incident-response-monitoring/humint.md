## Human Intelligence (HUMINT)

**Local Sneakernet -** Information shared by physical, face-to-face meetings with people in a local area.

**Text-Based Word-of-Mouth Information Exchange -** Simply texting local contacts (or trusted/high-confidence
sources) directly can provide real-time intelligence of the situation on the ground. Even if cellular
networks are overwhelmed, text-based services (either standard SMS messages or satellite-based
communications) can be very effective.
