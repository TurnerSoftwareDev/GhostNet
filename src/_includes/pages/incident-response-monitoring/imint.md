## Imagery Intelligence (IMINT)

**Satellite Imagery -** Helpful to download before internet connections are lost. Also, basic SRTM elevation
data would be helpful to have on hand to make maps with if needed. If internet connection is not available,
intercepting weather imagery from orbiting satellites would be useful as well.

**Drone Imagery -** For local imagery collection.

**Magnified Optics -** A good pair of binoculars of a spotting scope is very helpful for local observation.

**Thermal Optics -** Consumer grade thermal optics provide substantial force multiplication.

**Night Vision Optics -** Mandatory for observation of the local area at night.
