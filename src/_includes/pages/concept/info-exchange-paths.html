<p>Most users will likely find great utility in local communications throughout a region. For instance, if an
    incident were to occur within North America, most people in that region would likely tune in to JS8Call on
    40m to obtain more information. This is easy to do with a wide variety of equipment, and can be done even in
    a comparatively small location. Using a local 40m network, comms can be reliably established even in the
    worst of times, using minimal gear, and very little power.</p>

<p>However, the gear, space, power, and experience needed to make that same network functional around the
    world is quite a challenge. Different antenna arrangements, and an extensive knowledge of band conditions
    is usually required to make reliable links with contacts at extremely long ranges. The average radio operator
    can easily make contact throughout Europe, but making a contact at any time of day from Sweden to Australia
    is another story entirely. Band conditions alone require very specific parameters to be met to ensure the
    highest chance of success. Therefore, we need to establish specific times of day, freqs, and antenna configs to
    make these long range comms reliable.</p>
