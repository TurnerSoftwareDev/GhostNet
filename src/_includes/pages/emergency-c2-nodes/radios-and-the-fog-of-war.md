## HF vs VHF/UHF Radios and the Fog of War

Though handheld VHF/UHF radios are far more common,
if a C2 Node needs to relocate to ensure safety, or
in the worst case, is on the run and being pursued by
vastly superior forces, chances are the escapees will
quickly be far out of range of Line of Sight communications.
In that case, HF radio is really the only feasible
option to maintain contact without using preestablished
infrastructure. HF radio equipment must be as compact
and lightweight as possible, in the event that evasion
plans are enacted. Maintaining small QRP (low-power)
HF transceivers may not be as powerful as larger 50-
100 watt radios, but smaller rigs are easier to take with
you when you break out of encirclement, break contact
from an ambush, survive a drone strike, or any number
of serious issues. QRP radios allow the possibility of
establishing emergency C2 nodes upon rallying locals
following an attack. Though usually discarded as being
underpowered, a lot can be done with little power using
digital modes such as JS8Call, VarAC, Winlink, or any
other data modes.
