## Communications are a Priority

No Command and Control is possible without communication with other units, groups, or communities.
Among a prepared citizenry, which is not likely to be as organized, hierarchical, or disciplined as a formal
military unit, communications will be difficult during the best of times. If there is any hope of maintaining
even the most basic coordination during a time of crisis, extremely robust plans and standards must be
in place. Constant training and practice must be routinely carried out, specifically with communications
equipment, to ensure that at a momentâ€™s notice, alternative communications plans can instantly put in
place, without any loss of capability. Snap drills simulating a widespread cellular/internet outage are
great for ensuring skills do not become rusty.
