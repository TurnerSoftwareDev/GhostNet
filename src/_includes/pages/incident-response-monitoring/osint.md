## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

**Social Media Feeds -** If internet access permits, social media can be a valuable source for determining
whatâ€™s going on around the world. Social media will be the only source of information that most people
have, despite being heavily censored, surveilled, and increasingly unreliable. In a case of total devastation,
internet access will be limited or nonexistent. Plan accordingly, and use OSINT tools as long as they
are available, but always plan for that data link to be interrupted, censored, or subject to Information
Operations.
