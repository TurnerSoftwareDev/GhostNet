Understandably, such a seemingly complicated plan/infrastructure is bound to result in the question “Why
even bother with all this?”. Though the answers should be fairly obvious, below are few concepts that are
perhaps not adequately explained in the field of emergency communications:
- **He who owns the wires, owns the communication.** All internet communications are vulnerable to
  censorship, surveillance, entrapment, manipulation, and information warfare. Granted, this can apply to
  all communications on Earth, but there is a reason that powerful entities have spent substantial portions
  of defense budgets on information warfare and censorship tools. You can jump from platform to platform,
  being banned from one social media site before moving to the next. But the inconvenient truth is that radio
  is exceptionally difficult to influence by anyone. Though this may change in the future, radio is the ONLY
  option for communicating over long distances, without using anyone else’s infrastructure.
- **Comms can’t be established after a disaster, only before.** No meaningful comms network has ever been
  set up after a natural disaster strikes, and certainly not after a man-made disaster (such as war) breaks
  out in a region. During a crisis, people tend to be rather busy as the time-saving conveniences that make
  our modern society function stop working. There are only so many hours in the day, and if a person has
  to spend a lot of time establishing even the most basic comms links (and assuming risk doing so), this is
  time lost that could have been better spent on other tasks. It’s better to create the plan, practice it, and
  integrate it into daily life NOW, so that when all other comms are shut down or censored, the transition to
  radio is as seamless as possible.
- **A couple of “prepper freqs” is not good enough.** Shouting into your radio handset on doomsday is hardly
  likely to be effective. In 2023, even during significant emergencies, traditional voice comms that hams are
  known for are extremely ineffective. If we factor in the sheer number of people who own radios (even HF
  radios), we can clearly see that more significant network planning is needed. If the HF bands are so busy
  that the average user has a hard time breaking through on the average sunny Saturday afternoon, during
  a time of emergency comms won’t be possible at all. Thus the need for more substantial networks, modes,
  and methods that can handle higher volumes of varying kinds of traffic.
- **The average citizen is now playing for keeps.** No one lives forever, and in today’s world many people are
  finding out how true that adage really is. As such, resiliency in the face of an airstrike/raid is paramount.
  If a ham radio group cannot survive even a basic raid, they are of no help when the chips are down. this
  means that a “work-in-progress” plan is better than no plan at all. And more importantly, a
  non-hierarchical framework is essential for the network’s survival in the event of kinetic targeting.
