## Needed Hardware

1. **Software Defined Radio with a Windows (or Linux) PC to run it**: A simple SDR dongle can be configured
to receive HF radio transmissions. Some SDRs are more efficient on HF frequencies, but with an appropriate
antenna any SDR should be sufficient.
2. **HF Antenna**: Suitable for the frequencies you wish to receive. HF antennas for receiving can be built
more easily than ones used for transmitting, and in a pinch a long, random length of wire will work (albeit,
not very well).
3. **GPS Receiver**: A simple USB GPS dongle will function perfectly. You may need to install specific USB
drivers to allow it to function on your particular operation system.
