## JS8Call

Primarily an HF-based platform that, when installed on a computer linked to an HF radio, provides
the operator with keyboard-to-keyboard texting capabilities. JS8 excels at weak-signal interception,
and is well known for it’s comparatively user friendly interface. JS8 can also be used to relay
messages to stations BLOS, and is also capable of sending automated “heartbeat” messages to all
stations, providing instantaneous confirmation of range. Groups can also be established, creating ad
hoc nets as needed, with every station being notified of a group message, regardless of that station’s
callsign. As a result, JS8Call can be used to easily create medium-to-long range communications
networks as needed. And if a person knows which Group to follow, it’s not necessary for everyone to
know each other’s callsign. JS8 can also easily be used with custom, user-defined callsigns, in the
event of a cataclysmic emergency. JS8 is ideal for monitoring 24/7 as it requires little power, and the
automated Heartbeat messages periodically confirm that you are on the net. All the while, you can
receive messages, including messages from all over the world via JS8 relays. By primarily staying
on JS8, one’s own station can be readily available to relay others’ messages as well. Though far from
perfect, JS8 is the closest to an all-in-one solution for medium-long range text-based comms.
