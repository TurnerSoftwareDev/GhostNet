## Ad Hoc Crisis Nets

In the event GhostNet communications are needed,
GhostNets can be established at will. Chances are,
if a major incident is underway of grave importance,
someone will be talking about it on GhostNet. Hopping
on JS8Call to check for message traffic, or firing up
Ion2G during a crisis is not only helpful for sharing
information, but also great practice for when GhostNets
might be needed for more substantial emergencies.
