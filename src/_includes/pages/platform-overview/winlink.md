## WinLink

The undisputed champion of HF data connections, WinLink is one of the only email clients for sending
emails over HF radio. Comprising of a global network of gateways, WinLink is one of the most reliable
methods of sending emails with zero local infrastructure. However, there are some significant disadvantages.
Any connection whatsoever to internet servers presents very serious data privacy and
censorship concerns. Additionally, WinLink developers routinely verify callsigns on their platform,
so using WinLink without an FCC-approved callsign, even during an emergency, will result in your
account being deleted. We have verified this personally many times. Gatekeeping behavior such as
this is normally a dealbreaker for reliable communications. However, WinLink can be used in Peer-to-
Peer mode, completely bypassing WinLink gateways to send an email from one radio, to another.
This eliminates the main benefit of using WinLink (the global network of internet gateways), but is
censorship proof and hard to tamper with, either by authorities or by the developers themselves.
