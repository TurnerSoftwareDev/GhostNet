In the event of incidents occurring that require more active monitoring or response from average citizens,
ad hoc Tactical Operations Centers may be required for monitoring the situation. Command and Control
(C2) nodes may also be needed to coordinate the response of community members. In the event the situation
becomes untenable, or if breakout operations are necessary, various considerations and equipment
choices can ensure that communications can be maintained, even if on the run.
