## Persistent Comms Networks

For those who have the resources to spare, simply keeping an eye on the predetermined JS8Call
freqs throughout the day can be quite helpful. Setting up a receive-only JS8Call arrangement and just
leaving it running all day and night can be a great way to receive critical indications and warnings
of world events in real time. Though this may be a bit resource intensive for some, running JS8Call
around the clock requires very little CPU power, especially in receive-only mode. Though it would be
great to see JS8Call being used to share information 24/7, right now JS8 is more of a hobby for hams
than a tool for circumventing censorship/targeting. However, in due time JS8Callâ€™s unique characteristics
are great for group messages, and the heartbeat feature is a very resilient way to make sure
comms networks are functional at any time of day.
