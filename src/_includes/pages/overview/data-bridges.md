## Data Bridges (On Multiple Bands)

In the world of HF radio, everything is a trade-off. The configurations, frequencies,
and antennas needed to communicate over long distances are
not best suited for local comms, and vice versa. Therefore, to allow users
to have the best chance of success with extreme-long range comms,
networks have been established to allow links between continents and
regions, at the time and frequency that is most effective for each link.
Understandably, one weekly net, on only one or two bands is not robust
enough to handle substantial message traffic. When we start to consider
global partners, and the 24 hours in a day, we realize that a more substantial
plan is needed to allow users around the world to communicate.
Users in North America can usually only link up with Europeans during
certain times of day. Similar situations appear with other long-range
links, such as USA/Australia, Mediterranean/South America, Far East/
Europe, etc. As such, various comm plans have been established to allow
communications to occur between major regions, at the times of day
when there is the highest chance of success. In due time, we hope to
incorporate major relay stations which can facilitate the movement of
traffic 24/7. In this way, a person wishing to communicate with another
continent can wait for the data bridge to open at a certain time of day,
then use antenna configurations, power levels, frequencies, and data
modes that are more suited to long-range communications instead of
more local contacts.
