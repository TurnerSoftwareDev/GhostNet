We all live in strange and uncertain times. What is certain, however, is that accurate information is necessary
for survival. Consequently, censorship has become a household term as most citizens around the world
become victims of information warfare. This plainly obvious truth, while largely unspoken in the ham radio
community, is a fact of life for most of the Earth.
Therefore, network survivability must be a priority, but not in the ways that we traditionally think of. Yes, we
must prepare for power outages, systems going down, or any number of natural disasters. The ham radio
world is well prepared for these contingencies. What tends to get ignored, are the more nefarious communications
issues. Repeaters being kinetically targeted. Ham radio club members being arrested. Jamming. And
of course, surveillance. These real world events are not fear-mongering, these events have already occurred
and are fairly routine around the world. We mustnâ€™t dwell on this negativity, but we have to acknowledge
that a substantial portion of the ham radio infrastructure is not entirely suited to operate in a contested or
non-permissive environment. What good is a radio network if it reports directly to agencies that are targeting
it in the first place?

And what does this mean for those of us who do wish to operate in a less-than-friendly environment?
