40 meters is a great band for region-wide communications. Long-range data links are
perhaps best served by the more traditional DX bands, but 40m offers a good blend of
range and ease-of-use as it is usually the lowest band of frequencies that most radio
amateurs are capable of transmitting on regularly.
