## Meshtastic

A relatively new addition to the world of communications, Meshtastic has become the primary tool
for communities centered around low-power mesh communications using DIY LoRa (Long Range)
devices. The extremely low cost of equipment, and the compatibility of Meshtastic with the TAK suite
of software has resulted in Meshtastic becoming an extremely popular platform for short-medium
range text based communication, or CoT-style data exchange. Though this seems like a miracle
platform, the nature of open-source, grassroots development undertaken by volunteers means
that Meshtastic as an enterprise solution has had trouble getting out of the developmental phase.
Meshtastic will be hard pressed to replace military-grade comms tools, and it is quite buggy at times.
But Meshtastic is a fantastic, low-cost addition to any comm plan, and is one of the most reliable
ways to run ATAK effectively without using cellular data.
