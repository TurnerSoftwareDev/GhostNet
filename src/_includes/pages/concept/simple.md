**Though seemingly complex, the plan is quite simple.** Need to check in to a local net, or see whatâ€™s going
on throughout your region? Pick up this guide and flip to the card for your local area. Fire up whatever HF
transceiver you have (or even just a receiver) and tune in.

Need to send an email around the world? Flip the card over, find the link you want to make, wait until the
appropriate Data Bridge comm window opens up, and give it your best shot. This also allows for more
complicated relay stations to be set up in the future. For instance, a person in the US might be able to briefly
make limited contact with Australia on 80m, but contact might be sketchy or difficult to maintain. To send
a full email, they might have to relay longer messages through stations in Africa of the Mediterranean. This
comm plan allows for the network to grow and eventually make that a reliable option.
