## A Plan Comes Together

All of this means that there is no one single communications method...
each communications choice can compliment each other method. 20m HF transmissions can be used for
extreme-long-range comms, with 40m filling regional comms requirements, and VHF/UHF comms can
handle close range messaging needs. There are other options, such as Automatic Link Establishment programs,
which are vastly more capable (and automated). But remember: Communications, much like training,
defaults to the lowest common denominator. If you have a high speed HF ALE data-link setup, but the person
you need to talk to has a Baofeng, your communications efforts will be in vain. Everything is a balance...a
balance of what everyone on the net is capable of, all being influenced by the unpredictable and confusing
nature of the Fog of War.
