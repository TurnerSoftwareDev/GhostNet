## Leaving Room for Automatic Link Establishment

Ideally, ALE technology would make the concept of Data Bridges irrelevant. Even with enough power, reliable
contact can be made at will without waiting for a comm window. These Data Brides are made with the
portable operator in mind who might have to rearrange his/her antenna to make long range contacts. With
ALE, there is no guesswork to determine which band or time of day is most appropriate for a data link, as
the software computes this automatically. This is why ALE is the gold standard for military communications
links around the world. However, among radio amateurs, ALE is still in its infancy. Ion2G is the front-runner
software package intended to encourage more ALE-based comms in the ham radio world, but the antenna
and transceiver requirements make ALE cost prohibitive for most radio operators.

However, since ALE is the future, we can still allow for an ALE comm window. ALE is not magic, it simply
chooses the best frequency to make a link between two points. At the moment, Ion2G in particular can only
really be used for simple text messages, or voice calls. Sending emails must still be done using traditional
Winlink P2P methods. This means that ALE can remove the guesswork when it comes to frequency choice, but
the time of day must still be chosen by the operator*, and using different data modes (like RTTY) still requires
manual decision making by the radio operator. One must remember that cutting-edge technology (in the ham
world anyway), is perhaps not the most reliable in a serious emergency. Therefore, we can allow for the use
of Ion2G by creating a specific time window for its use, but we also want to allow for other more manually
selected networks to function using the equipment that most people already have.

<p class="footnote">*Ion2G is best used by leaving the software to run 24/7. However, this is not the best option for most radio operators as 1- it ties up resources, and 2- the
clicking of relays in the radio 24/7 is not appealing to most people. Various work-arounds exist to make Ion2G a viable persistent system, but as this
software is still in development trusting it with oneâ€™s life is not advised unless a highly reliable backup solution is also in place...like a Data Bridge.</p>
