Any decentralized, uncensorable platform is a double-edged sword. Offering on the one hand truly
free speech, but on the other providing a network for malign actors to influence. On the radio waves,
there is no “block” button, and users may hear opinions that they do not agree with. This is even
more true of a network like the GhostNet, which has no Net Control, no single point of failure. To us,
this is a an acceptable compromise toward the goal of attaining real free speech. However, as the
overall goal is information exchange that is helpful for the average person, below are some best
practices that can help us all make the most of the platform. Users will get out of GhostNet what
they put into it; garbage in, garbage out. Let’s work toward providing quality content for all:

## Check in Early for Testing

A major part of GhostNet is the ability to test gear, and check in with friends. However, with such a small
comm window (and hundreds of users), the waterfall can get pretty busy. As such, if you are just beginning
or testing out gear, feel free to hop on 30 minutes to an hour before the actual comm window starts. There
is enough persistent traffic 24/7 to check your gear before the meeting time, so that we can save a bit of
bandwidth for communication.

## Try to Limit CQs/MSG checks/SNR Reports During Comm Window

All of these features are excellent, and should certainly be used. However, with so many users active
during the comm windows, it would be a good idea to do these checks before or after the window. One user
requesting an SNR report from the @GhostNet tag causes dozens of rigs to transmit simultaneously...and if
a different person does this ever minute or two, most people’s inboxes are filled with SNR reports instead of
news reports, intel updates, etc. Likewise, if you want, feel free to share a brief news report or two during the
comm window. Sharing information is what this is all about!

## Be Mindful of QRP Stations

Always remember that one often transmits farther than their antenna can hear. It is quite common for more
high powered stations to accidentally transmit over smaller stations. Remember the golden rule of radio:
Only use enough power to complete the communication. Remember, we’re trying to give the smaller stations
a shot, as QRP rigs are extremely common transceivers for beginners. We don’t want to alienate newer operators
because they don’t have a really powerful rig, or a super efficient antenna.

## Understand the Cultural Barriers

Ham radio has a unique culture. Sometimes this culture is not great, and really discouraging towards new
users. As much as we might not like to talk about it, it’s the truth. Some operators don’t like new things, and
don’t respect the effort we have undertaken to simply provide another communication option. Some other
networks think that the GhostNet is hostile towards their own work (which it most certainly is not!). Hams
have been observed trying to intentionally jam the network, and generally cause trouble. No plan is perfect,
but we are at least trying to improve communications in a time when humanity’s freedoms are at risk. It is
with this in mind that we move forward, helping people where we can, and learning a lot along the way. The
unspoken cultural issues within amateur radio are obvious to any newcomer, but let’s remind ourselves that
the culture is changing for the better...even if we have a long way to go.
