**Organization will be haphazard:** No net control or “main” station means that a single airstrike cannot disrupt
communications...taking out the leader won’t work when there is no one leader. This makes for haphazard
and disorganized communications, but it’s the best that we can hope for in a situation of desperation.

**Competing Interests Cloud Information Exchange:** It’s easy to create echo chambers, and only allow the free
speech that a particular group of people agree on. However, if one has the very broad goal of simply allowing
others to communicate with each other over long distances, when all other methods of communication
are either surveilled or not available, ideology, politics, and personalities will become a problem over time.
Everyone is different, and has different ideas of solutions to the world’s problems. With no strong, top-down
leadership, a system such as this has the potential to descend into cliques, political echo chambers, and
general chaos. As HF radio is not super popular right now amongst the general public, these kinds of
communications networks tend to attract the more dedicated and altruistic personalities, which is why this
is not a large problem for now. Over time, as censorship becomes even more constricting, it becomes ever
more important for every user to be the best person they can be, and reflect the goodness they wish to see
in the world.

**The Issue of Timing:** One of the first questions we must ask ourselves when responding to any issue is: How
much time do we have to work with? Though this idea is a concern with more formalized public-service
incident and Rescue organizations, from a more “prepared citizenry” perspective, timing is more important.
Unlike public services, which have strict “work the problem until it’s solved, escalating assistance to higher
levels as needed until mission complete” mindset, the average citizen might have to “break contact” while
working an incident if it is determined that not enough time remains to be of any use.

**Complications and the Fog of War:** “No plan survives first contact”. This phrase, a common utterance on the
battlefield, also most certainly applies to the entire field of communications...especially the communications
on the battlefield. Reliable communications in combat, while rarely given credit when things go well...is the
most often cited complaint when people get killed. Communications is not alluring to most, but if you don’t
get it right, your chances of survival are remote. This is why understanding the unique nature of combat
is necessary for success; if comms are good, clean, and efficient during peacetime, they might be barely
successful during wartime. But if comms are nonexistent during the best of times, it will be impossible to
establish comms during the worst of times. Communications in war is often times utter chaos; an adventure
of utter madness, with no one knowing what’s going on until the combat situation has reached a conclusion.
Thus, we must often times choose the communications methods that are not the best, or even the most
efficient...but rather the comms methods that are functional, rugged, reliable, repeatable, and accessible by
the lowest common denominator. However, despite the assertations that “simple is best”, a certain level of
complexity is required in order to ensure that all the bases are covered, and as many situations as possible
are planned for.
