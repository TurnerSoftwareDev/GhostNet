## Step 4: Hotwash, After Action Review, Logistical Recovery

As an incident comes to a close, or begins to settle in for the long haul, logistical capabilities must be
considered. Personnel issues will be paramount as prepared citizens often are not capable of assisting
with incident recovery 24/7. Conducting Hotwashes/AARâ€™s will help increase efficiency, identify deficiencies,
and improve response efforts for the next incident.
